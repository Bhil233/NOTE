It is known that the amplitude of a single-frequency FM wave is 10V, the instantaneous frequency is f(t) = $10^5+10^4\cos(2\pi*10^3)$(Hz) 
(a) What is the expvession for this FM wave (5)
(b) What is the maximum frquency offset , FM index and frquency bandwith of this FM wave (5)

Assume a chanul is with double-side noise power densty $p_n(f) = 0.5*10^{-8}w/Hz$ The handwith limit of modulatoy double side band singal m(t) is 5Hz carrier signal frequency is 100KHz transmitter signal power is St = 60dB channle loss α is 70dB for modulator , try to deter mine.
(a) Ideal bandpass filter : central frequnency and bandwith.
(b) Input SNR
(c) Output SNR
(d) Output noise power density
